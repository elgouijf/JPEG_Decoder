# JPEG_Decoder
This project is a JPEG image decoder written in C. The goal was to implement a complete JPEG-to-PPM/PGM conversion pipeline without relying on external libraries. The decoder supports baseline JPEG files and reads the bitstream directly at the binary level. Throughout the project, several optimizations were applied to improve performance.
